<!-- Browse Items

On the browse items page, the user sees a list of items they can add to their cart and purchase. Again, the kind of items and the formatting of this page is up to you.

You should provide a button or link to add an item to the cart. Doing so should store that item in some way to the session, and then keep the user on the browse page.

View Cart

Your browse page should contain a link to view the cart. On the view cart page, the user can see all the items that are in their cart. Provide a way to remove individual items from the cart.

The view cart page should have a link to return to the browse page for more shopping and a link to continue to the checkout page.

Checkout

The checkout page should ask the user for the different components of their address. (No credit card or other purchase information is collected, only an address.)

It should have the option to complete the purchase or return to the cart.

Confirmation page

After completing the purchase from the checkout page, the user is shown a confirmation page. It should display all the items they have just purchased as well as the address to which it will be shipped.

Make sure to check for malicious injection, especially from free-entry fields like the address. -->
